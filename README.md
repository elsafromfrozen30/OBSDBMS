# Online Banking System using DBMS
Introduction:
Bank of Unity is a bank that is known for their service to the customers and is one of the most trusted banks in the nation. This is a banking system that enables a customer to withdraw, deposit and make transactions with their money without facing any kind of trouble. There is some interest involved while making these transactions which may have an impact on the money loaned or deposited in the bank.
The main purpose of the online banking system is to allow the administrators to secure and keep track of the deposits, withdrawals and the transactions made by the customers and it individually enables the user to keep track of his/her funds from the comfort of their own homes. A user can check their bank account details, withdraw, deposit and transfer money between accounts; and the database keeps track of all the information and any changes made in it.

Functionalities of the system:
The three main functionalities of the database involved in an online banking system are:
1. For depositing money into the bank (principal amount) for which the amount deposited would increase as the bank pays interest at a certain rate
2. To withdraw/take a loan from the bank for a certain period for which the person has to repay the money with additional interest
3. To transfer money to another account across different banks or in the same bank
The user will obviously have to access the online banking system after creating their account with their official name, username, password, mobile number, credit card number, etc. Some of these fields will be accessible only to the user besides the administrators. They can then login with the credentials which they had used earlier to create their account.
There will be two kinds of people involved—the users and the administrators. The administrator can create the tables and add, update, modify or delete columns and records while the user can access only their details. Besides, the user can deposit, withdraw or transfer money to or from their account and view their transaction details.

Modules in the system:
There will be seven tables involved:
1. Customer Information
2. Administrator Information
3. Account Information
4. Transaction details
5. Bank details
6. Loan information
7. Insurance Information

Output:
1. Administrator view—customer wise, account details (name, age, phone number, credit card number, account number etc.)
2. Customer view—view their personal details, transaction details, funds.

Benefits:
Here are some of the benefits that an online banking system provides:
1. Faster payment.
2. Accessibility and hassle free.
3. Automatic reminders.
4. Privacy and security.
5. Low maintenance costs and less paperwork.
